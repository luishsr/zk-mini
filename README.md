# zk-mini

zk-mini is a minimal zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) framework implemented in Rust, designed to demonstrate the basic principles behind zero-knowledge proofs. This project includes custom implementations for circuits and constraint systems and supports simple examples such as addition, multiplication, and Merkle tree proofs.

Features
Circuit Components: Support for addition, multiplication, and hash gates.
Merkle Tree Proofs: Demonstrates how ZKPs can verify membership in a Merkle tree.
Modular Hashing: Allows custom hash functions to be injected into the circuit.
Serialization: Saves proofs and circuits to .bin files for inspection.
Installation
To get started, clone the repository and build the project with Rust’s package manager, cargo.

bash
Copy code
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zk-mini.git
cd zk-mini

# Build the project in release mode
cargo build --release
Usage
The project includes a main program that demonstrates generating and verifying ZK proofs for various examples, including addition, multiplication, and Merkle tree membership.

To run the examples:

bash
Copy code
cargo run --release
Running Examples
Running cargo run --release will generate proof files for each example:

Addition Proof: Generates an addition proof and saves it to addition_proof.bin.
Multiplication Proof: Generates a multiplication proof and saves it to multiplication_proof.bin.
Custom Hashing Proof: Demonstrates custom hash functions, saved to custom_hash_proof.bin.
Merkle Tree Proof: Verifies a transaction in a Merkle tree and saves the proof to merkle_proof.bin.
Viewing Proof Files
The .bin files generated by the program contain serialized proof data. To inspect these files:

Hex Editor: Open the files in a hex editor (like Hex Fiend for macOS).
Rust Deserialization: Use the provided Rust code to deserialize and print the contents of these files for easier inspection.
File Structure
src/
main.rs: Entry point, demonstrating usage of the framework.
circuit.rs: Circuit component with modular gates and customizable hash functions.
r1cs.rs: Defines the constraint system and checks if constraints are satisfied.
merkle.rs: Provides Merkle tree functionality.
hash_functions.rs: Allows defining custom hash functions to be used within the circuit.
